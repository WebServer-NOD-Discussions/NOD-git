NOD is programmed to take input for protein sequence(s) in one of the FASTA formats (For now, the NOD friendly extensions are:
										(.FASTA, .fasta, .fas, .faa, .fa)

*************/Following is a small description to get the user acquainted to FASTA format for protein sequences.*************/

>FASTA FILE FORMAT:
A text-based format for representing either nucleotide or peptide sequences. The sequence is composed of a series of standard 
IUB/IUPAC single letter codes for amino acid or nucleotide bases. Since NOD works only with protein sequences, hereafter the 
fasta format discussed is only for protein sequences and NOT for nucleotide sequences.
Each sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by line(s) of sequence data.
The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than '>' symbol at the very start of the line. The
following line or lines shall contain the protein sequence.

>CANONICAL .FASTA FORMAT:
Traditionally a .fasta file shall have a canonical .FASTA format as described in below points.
	1. The first line of each sequence is called DESCRIPTOR. It shall start with a '>' symbol followed by the database notifier
	of the sequence. For eg. if the sequence arises from Swiss-prot DB (>sp), if it arises from NCBI RefSeq (>ref, >gi, etc.).
	If the sequence is not submitted in any public DB, user can choose their own identifiers (>NOD, >newSeq, etc.)
	2. The DB notifier is followed by a pipe character '|' that separates the accession code from the preceeding DB notifier and
	a following pipe character separating it from the succeeding fields. The accession codes arise from public sequence databases. 
	Incase, the sequence is not from a public database, the field can be left empty.
	3. The (>DBnotifier|accession|) is followed by the source organism of the sequence thus making the descriptor formatted as:
	>DBnotifier | seq. Accession | Source Organism general description about the sequence and its characteristics
	4. This line is followed by the actual sequence of the protein. The canonical .FASTA format limits 60 characters per line.
	Therefore, a sequence that is longer than 60 amino acids shall be split in (Total sequence length/60) lines.
	
An example sequence in canonical .FASTA format:

	>sp|P02144|MYG_HUMAN Myoglobin OS=Homo sapiens OX=9606 GN=MB
	MGLSDGEWQLVLNVWGKVEADIPGHGQEVLIRLFKGHPETLEKFDKFKHLKSEDEMKASE
	DLKKHGATVLTALGGILKKKGHHEAEIKPLAQSHATKHKIPVKYLEFISECIIQVLQSKH
	PGDFGADAQGAMNKALELFRKDMASNYKELGFQG
		
		Thus the sequence header (descriptor) above details the following information for the given sequence.
		I) 	      >sp|:	The sequence arises from SwissProt database.
		II)	 |P022144|:	The accession number with which the sequence is accessible in the UniProt database.
		III)|MYG_HUMAN:	The details about the protein name (Myoglobin) and its source organism: Human, followed by other details.
		IV)	  Sequence:	The single letter amino acid codes for protein sequence.
		Each line is delimited at 60 characters.
	
	The accepted IUPAC amino acid codes are:

        A ALA alanine                         P PRO proline
        B ASX aspartate or asparagine         Q GLN glutamine
        C CYS cystine                         R ARG arginine
        D ASP aspartate                       S SER serine
        E GLU glutamate                       T THR threonine
        F PHE phenylalanine                   U     selenocysteine
        G GLY glycine                         V VAL valine
        H HIS histidine                       W TRP tryptophan
        I ILE isoleucine                      Y TYR tyrosine
        K LYS lysine                          Z GLX glutamate or glutamine
        L LEU leucine                         X     any
        M MET methionine                      -     gap of indeterminate length
        N ASN asparagine                      

The format is widely acceptable across databases and webserver as it is easy to parse important information from the header and the
sequence is also represented in a machine-friendly as well as human-friendly manner.

>The .FASTA format has also evolved over time and has multiple derivatives of the canonical format that are available. Following are
the examples of such .fasta format derivatives:
	
	1.	>refseq|noAcc|query protein; random sequence from human proteome.

Although NOD would intake any of the above described .fasta formats. The NOD treats the canonical .fasta format as the most suitable for its
processing pipeline. The file extension can vary as per user descrition. Any file extensions acceptable to be read as the internet media 
text/x-fasta would work until the sequence provided inside the file has .fasta format.
